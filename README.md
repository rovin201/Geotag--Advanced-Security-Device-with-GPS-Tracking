# Geotag- Advanced Security Device with GPS Tracking

Safety devices are important due to their paramount role in safeguarding users by providing help under unprecedented situations. This concept introduces a cutting-edge Internet of Everything (IOE) initiative aimed at creating an all-encompassing device designed to enhance safety. It achieves this by continuously monitoring a user's location and promptly detecting the presence of smoke in the event of a fire. Ensuring public safety has emerged as a matter of utmost significance, underscored by the alarming statistic that every 40 seconds, an individual becomes unaccounted for. The device integrates a GPS module for precise location tracking to help users when under threat. The device is also equipped with a smoke detection sensor that is activated by the detection of smoke surpassing a predetermined threshold, which will help provide assistance in the event of a fire. The device addresses personal safety by providing the users a way to alert authorities by the press of a button. Gas leaks and fires are most perilous domestic and workplace hazards, the devices ability to  detect these gases and send alters helps prevent catastrophic accidents.
