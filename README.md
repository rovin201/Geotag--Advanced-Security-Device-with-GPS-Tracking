# Geotag- Advanced Security Device with GPS Tracking

Safety devices are important due to their paramount role in safeguarding users by providing help under unprecedented situations. This concept introduces a cutting-edge Internet of Everything (IOE) initiative aimed at creating an all-encompassing device designed to enhance safety. It achieves this by continuously monitoring a user's location and promptly detecting the presence of smoke in the event of a fire. Ensuring public safety has emerged as a matter of utmost significance, underscored by the alarming statistic that every 40 seconds, an individual becomes unaccounted for.
